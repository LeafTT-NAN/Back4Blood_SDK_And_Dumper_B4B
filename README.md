## About The Dumper

#### The Dumper is from [Encryqed's Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7),But the latest version has a [issues](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7/issues/292) so you have to use [the old version of the dumper](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7/tree/a1c081109d3191eaba140f6f26f2daf9fd102b7c) and override GNames manually
## How To Use Dumper(B4B)
#### I have updated a dumper that already modified and ready to use
###### 1. Download dumper and build it
###### 2. Start your game and wait to MainMenu
###### 3. Inject dll into Back 4 Blood and wait for generate sdk(It will generate in “C:\Dumper-7\”, this can be modified manually before build)
###### 4. When it outputs “Generating SDK took (XXXXXms)”, you can close the dumper and working on you sdk:）

## Bypass Anti-Cheat(B4B)
###### 1. Open your game directory and rename "start_protected_game.exe" to other(e.g start_protected_game1.exe)
###### 2. Download "bypass.exe" to your game directory and rename it to "start_protected_game.exe"
###### 3. Start your game and enjoy(Offline Only!)
###### 4. To restore it ,delete bypass.exe and change the original anti cheating file name back to “start_protected_game.exe”
